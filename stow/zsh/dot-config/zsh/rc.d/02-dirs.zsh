# Named directories

# Set these early, because it affects how dirs are displayed and printed.

# Create shortcuts for your favorite directories.
# `hash -d <name>=<path>` makes ~<name> a shortcut for <path>.
# You can use this ~name anywhere you would specify a dir, not just with `cd`!

hash -d g=$gitdir


# Change dirs without `cd`. Just type the dir and press enter.
# Note: This will misfire if there is an alias, function, builtin or command
# with the same name!
# To be safe, use autocd only with paths starting with ~ (including named
# directories), .. or /
