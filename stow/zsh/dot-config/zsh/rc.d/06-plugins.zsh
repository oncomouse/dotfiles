# zsh-autocomplete sends *a lot* of characters to your terminal. This is fine
# locally on modern machines, but if you're working through a slow ssh
# connection, you might want to add a slight delay before the autocompletion
# kicks in:
# zstyle ':autocomplete:*' min-delay 1.0  # seconds
#
# If your connection is VERY slow, then you might want to disable
# autocompletion completely and use only tab completion instead:
# zstyle ':autocomplete:*' async no


# Speed up the first startup by cloning all plugins in parallel.
# This won't clone plugins that we already have.
znap clone $plugins

# Load each plugin, one at a time.

done

# `znap eval <name> '<command>'` is like `eval "$( <command> )"` but with
# caching and compilation of <command>'s output, making it ~10 times faster.
znap eval zcolors zcolors   # Extra init code needed for zcolors.
